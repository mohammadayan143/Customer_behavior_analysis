Data Analytics Project
Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from data ingestion and exploration to database querying and dashboard development. It highlights practical skills in Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), and Power BI—showing the ability to work with real-world datasets, clean and transform data, and communicate insights effectively.

1.Project Workflow
1.1 Data Loading (Python)
Imported the dataset using Python (Pandas).
Reviewed file structure, data types, and overall dataset quality.
Verified data consistency and identified initial issues such as missing values or duplicates.

1.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explored key variables and relationships.
Generated summary statistics and visualizations.
Identified trends, outliers, and potential data quality problems.
Used libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

1.3 Data Cleaning
Handled missing and inconsistent values.
Removed duplicates and standardized formats.
Created new derived features when necessary.
Ensured the dataset was reliable and ready for deeper analysis.

1.4 SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)
Loaded the cleaned dataset into a PostgreSQL database.
Wrote SQL queries to:
Extract and filter data
Perform aggregations
Join tables
Validate findings from Python analysis
Ensured reproducibility and optimized query performance where possible.

1.5 Power BI Dashboard
Connected Power BI to the cleaned dataset / PostgreSQL database.
Built an interactive dashboard to:
Visualize key KPIs
Highlight trends and insights
Allow end-users to explore data through slicers and filters
Focused on clarity, storytelling, and user-friendly design.

2.Tools & Technologies
